# Introduction to EECS I

## Course Information
This repository contains summary of the my coursework for [**MIT 6.01: Introduction to Electrical Engineering and Computer Science 1**](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-01sc-introduction-to-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science-i-spring-2011/index.htm). 

This course provides an integrated introduction to electrical engineering and computer science. The primary goal is to learn to use the fundamental design principles of modularity and abstraction in a variety of contexts from electrical engineering and computer science. The secondary goal is to learn how making mathematical models of real systems can help in the design and analysis of those systems.

The course is divided into 4 units:

- Software Engineering
- Signals and Systems
- Circuits
- Probability and Planning
